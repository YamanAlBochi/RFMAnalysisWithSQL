# RFMAnalysisWithSQL.
I explore a sales dataset and generate various analytics and insights from customers' past purchase behavior. i go from analyzing sales revenue to creating a customer segmentation analysis using the RFM technique. Using basic SQL queries to exploring complex problems using SUB QUERY, CTEs, AGGREGATE, and WINDOW functions. I work on the following skills:
- Importing a file into SQL Server Database
- SQL Aggregate Functions.
- SQL Window Functions
- SQL Sub Query
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- SQL XML Path Function
- Tableau


What is RFM Segmentation Analysis?

An RFM report; is a way of segmenting customers using three key metrics: recency (how long ago their last purchase was), frequency (how often they purchase), and monetary value (how much they spent).........

The Analysis is included with the TSQL File.
